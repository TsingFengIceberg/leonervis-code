Leonervis Code is a learning-first coding-agent CLI prototype for local, single-user use. It will incrementally build an understandable and verifiable Harness: a model makes decisions, the host executes controlled tools within explicit workspace and permission boundaries, and structured results return to the model.

> **Current status: environment bootstrap is complete; the Harness runtime is not implemented yet.** The project can now be installed, its commands inspected, and its basic quality checks run. It cannot yet perform real agent tasks.

## Project positioning

This project does not attempt to reproduce, replace, or promise compatibility with Claude Code or any other existing product. Its first phase focuses on Harness fundamentals: controlled model calls, tool execution, workspace boundaries, approval, structured events, and deterministic tests.

Implementation progresses through small, complete learning slices. Each slice adds only the code and dependencies it needs, and records its design rationale, data flow, reference differences, known boundary, and test evidence. It will not create empty early shells for MCP, plugins, multi-agent systems, servers, RAG, or background tasks merely to appear complete.

Related Harness reading and learning notes are available in [Harness-study](https://github.com/TsingFengIceberg/Harness-study).

## Requirements

| Item | Current requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | **3.12** development/test baseline; 3.13 allowed | The project declares `>=3.12,<3.14`. |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Latest stable version | The sole manager for Python packages, virtual environments, and lockfiles. |
| Git | Any current stable version | Used for version control; not a Python dependency. |
| pytest | `>=8.3` | Current deterministic test runner. |
| Ruff | `>=0.9` | Current static-checking and formatting tool. |

The root [`.python-version`](./.python-version) selects Python 3.12 by default. If that interpreter is unavailable locally, `uv` will prompt during synchronization; alternatively, install it with `uv python install 3.12`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Enter the repository after cloning it
cd leonervis-code

# 2. Create .venv, install dependencies, and synchronize from uv.lock
uv sync

# 3. Inspect the available bootstrap CLI
uv run leonervis-code --help
uv run leonervis --version
```

The two command names point to the same entry point: `leonervis-code` is the formal command and `leonervis` is its shorthand. A module entry point is also available:

```bash
uv run python -m leonervis_code --help
```

At this stage, invoking the command without `--help` or `--version` explicitly reports that the Harness runtime is not implemented and exits nonzero. It is intentionally not a misleading placeholder for a working agent.

## Development and verification

Run every project command through `uv run` so it uses the locked environment:

```bash
# Deterministic tests
uv run pytest

# Static checks
uv run ruff check .

# Check formatting; remove --check to apply formatting
uv run ruff format --check .
```

When dependencies change, update and verify the lockfile:

```bash
uv lock
uv lock --check
```

## Leonervis Code environment vs. target-workspace environment

Leonervis Code itself currently requires only Python, uv, Git, and the Python packages locked in `uv.lock`. It does **not** install build environments for projects it will eventually work on.

For example, when a future agent runs `npm test` in a Node project, Node/npm belongs to that **target workspace**. The same distinction applies to Rust/Cargo, Java, Docker, and a project's database. They are not prerequisites for launching Leonervis Code.

Accordingly, Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js, npm, pnpm, Rust, Java, Go, databases, Redis, message queues, web servers, reverse proxies, and Makefiles are not needed today.

## Current scope and future direction

The repository now includes:

- a reproducible Python 3.12–3.13 and uv environment with `uv.lock`;
- installable `leonervis-code` / `leonervis` entry points plus `python -m leonervis_code`;
- a minimal `pytest` and `ruff` quality toolchain; and
- a bootstrap CLI that explicitly reports the runtime is not implemented yet.

The first implementation slice will next establish a minimal, testable Harness foundation: core contracts, deterministic test doubles, a bounded agent loop, and a minimal CLI. Model integration, file tools, write approvals, sessions, and controlled Bash will each arrive only in their own learning slice.

MCP, plugins, remote/server forms, multi-agent coordination, RAG, and background work are not permanently ruled out. They will be introduced only after a concrete need, boundary design, and test plan exist.

## Repository layout

```text
src/leonervis_code/    # the only production Python package; bootstrap CLI only for now
tests/                 # unit, integration, security, and end-to-end tests will grow here
docs/                  # architecture decisions, learning notes, and security design
scripts/               # reproducible local/CI maintenance commands, added when needed
learning-submodules/   # read-only learning references
```

Repositories under `learning-submodules/` are read-only study materials. They are not runtime dependencies, and product code must never import them. When their design informs an implementation, Leonervis Code will document both the inspiration and its own deliberate differences.
